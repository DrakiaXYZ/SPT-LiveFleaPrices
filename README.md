# Welcome to the SPT-AKI Modding Project

This project is designed to streamline the initial setup process for building and creating mods in the SPT-AKI environment. Follow this guide to set up your environment efficiently.

## **NodeJS Setup**

Before you begin, ensure to install NodeJS version `v18.15.0`, which has been tested thoroughly with our mod templates and build scripts. Download it from the [official NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/).

After installation, it's advised to reboot your system.

## **IDE Setup**

For this project, you can work with either [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, we strongly recommend using VSCode, as all development and testing have been carried out using this IDE, ensuring a smoother experience and compatibility with the project setups. Either way, we have a prepared a workspace file to assist you in setting up your environment.

## **Workspace Configuration**

With NodeJS and your chosen IDE ready, initiate the `mod.code-workspace` file using your IDE:

> File -> Open Workspace from File...

Upon project loading, consider installing recommended plugins like the ESLint plugin.

## **Environment Setup**

An automated task is available to configure your environment for Typescript utilization:

> Terminal -> Run Task... -> Show All Tasks... -> npm: install

Note: Preserve the `node_modules` folder as it contains necessary dependencies for Typescript and other functionalities.

## **Essential Concepts**

Prioritize understanding Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control, the architectural principles SPT-AKI adopts. Comprehensive guidelines will be available on the hub upon release.

Some resources to get you started:
 - [A quick intro to Dependency Injection](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-quick-intro-to-dependency-injection-what-it-is-and-when-to-use-it-7578c84fa88f/)
 - [Understanding Inversion of Control (IoC) Principle](https://medium.com/@amitkma/understanding-inversion-of-control-ioc-principle-163b1dc97454)

## **Coding Guidelines**

Focus your mod development around the `mod.ts` file. In the `package.json` file, only alter these properties: `"name"`, `"version"`, `"license"`, `"author"`, and `"akiVersion"`. 

New to Typescript? Find comprehensive documentation on the [official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

## **Distribution Guidelines**

Automated tasks are set up to bundle all necessary files for your mod to function in SPT-AKI:

> Terminal -> Run Task... -> Show All Tasks... -> npm: build

The ZIP output, located in the `dist` directory, contains all required files. Ensure all files are included and modify the `.buildignore` file as needed. This ZIP file is your uploadable asset for the hub.

## **Conclusion**

With this setup, you're ready to begin modding with SPT-AKI. If you run into any trouble be sure to check out the [modding documentation on the hub](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/doc/lexicon/66-modding/).
